<h3>🛠️Techinal Details</h3>

The project was built from the ground up in a modular fashion using the VIPER architecture. We utilized a single network layer with a Generic Network and EndPoint structure to handle all kinds of models. To avoid code repetition for frequently used UI elements, we segmented them into separate classes. We employed the Generic View Controller structure to keep the Controller and View layers separate. Data transfer was facilitated through protocols at every point in the application. No layer was burdened with tasks outside its scope. As a result, a modular, maintainable, and testable project emerged.
